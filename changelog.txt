Version: 2.1.0
  Changes:
    - Began keeping a changelog
    - Completely redid prototype generation of robots to copy the default robots and tweak values, rather than defining an entirely new prototype from scratch
    - Also redid entity prototype of Roboports to copy base entities and modify them for similar reasons
    - Robots now have their stats scale with a function based on their tier, rather than by arbitrary values
  Bugfixes:
    - Updated recipe for robot 1 to not use flying robot frames as the unlock science is pre-oil
